it is the extra file for the things that I have done in this example.

actually, to add css styles, we can do that different apporaches.

approach one:

we can add css using object itself in the component itself like below.

   const styles={
                header:{
                    background: 'teal'
                },
                logo:{
                    color: 'white',
                    fontSize: '35px',
                    textAlign: 'center'
                }
            }

we can use it using:

 <header style={styles.header}>
                <div style={styles.logo}>Logo</div>
</header>

-----------------------------------------------------

second way of adding css is to keep a public styles.css file, and we can add
properties to it and add that file path in index.html file.

----------------------------------------------------------

third way of doing it is, if we want to add styels to a partilcular component, you can add 
css for that particular js file itself, and then we can access it by importing in js file.

in this thrid apporach, one more inp thing to know is,

if we are adding as a class name, then usually we will add as 
<div class='logo/>
and then in css
.logo{

}
 we will use like above, and in react, even though we didn't get any error, we shouldn't
 give it like that, it is because, in react 'class' is a reserved keyword, 
 so that we should not use it as class, instead we can use it as 'className'

 <div className='logo'/>
